## About me

Hello, this is **Taehyeon Kim**. I'm a **Ph D Candidate** in Optimization and Statistical Inference Lab [OSI](http://osi.kaist.ac.kr/) (Advisor: Se-young Yun, KAIST). Junior researcher!! haha:) During 6 months (2021.06 - 2021.12), I'm a **Computer Vision and Machine Learning R&D Intern for Autonomous Drivingreporting* in **QualCoom**.

My research interests lie in **optimization** for training deep neural networks, automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems (**AutoML**), **Trustworthy and real-world** AI/ML challenges, and train an algorithm across multiple decentralized edge devices (**Federated Learning**). My research has been presented in several conferences and organizations. Please refer to my [CV](https://Kthyeon.github.io/Taehyeon_CV.pdf)!

Now, I'm carrying out various activities including winning awards in challenges, being a representative for leading team members, and teaching theories and practices of deep learning.

I love to enjoy solving new challenges with collaborators. Hello! &#128525;
